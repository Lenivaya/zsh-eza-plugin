# zsh-eza-plugin

This zsh plugin enables a number of aliases allowing `eza`, to act as a drop-in
replacement for `ls` and `tree`.

## Installation

Install [`eza`](https://the.eza.website). See
[eza installation](https://the.eza.website/#installation) for platform specific
installation instructions.

Next, download this repo into your custom plugins directory. For my installation
using [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), Clone the repo to
`~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`.

Finally, add `zsh-eza-plugin` to the plugins array of your zshrc file:

```sh
plugins=(... zsh-aliases-eza)
```
